Sat Chat - Random Orbit

Sat Chat is part of http://randomorbit.net and was developed during http://sciencehackday.com/ .

Add sat-chat@appspot.com and talk to the satellites. Make sure you say hello, ask them where they are and where they're going.

This uses:
* AppEngine for hosting
* AppEngine's XMPP
* http://randomorbit.net for satellite telemetry predictions
* YQL / Flickr places for lat-long stuff
